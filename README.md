# fresh project

Fresh doesn't support recursive partial hydration so need to make the comments component an Island. Didn't implement user route.

You can try it on deno-deploy [here](https://ryansolid-fresh-hackernews.deno.dev/)

### Usage

Start the project:

```
deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.
